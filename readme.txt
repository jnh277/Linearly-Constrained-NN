This code has been submitted as supplementary material to support the submission "Linearly Constrained Neural Networks".

To run the examples the following python packages are required:
> torch
> matplotlib
> numpy
> math
> scipy

Four demo python scripts are included:
> simulted_divergence_free.py: Runs the example from Section 5.1 and produces the results shown in Figure 4.
> constraint_violation_demo.py: Runs the example from the end of Section 5.1 which demonstrates how the proposed approach always satisfies the constraints whilst a standard neural network does not and produces the results shown in Figure 5.
> strain_field.py: Runs the example in section 5.2 and produces the results shown in Figure 6.
> real_data.py: Runs the example in section 5.3 and produces the results shown in Figure 1.
